                    debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and UK Albums Chart. It was one of the best-selling albums of the year,

                     This made her the first artist born in the 21st century to release a chart-topping single. The following year,
                      Eilish performed the theme song "No Time to Die" for the James Bond film of the same name, 
                      which topped the UK Singles Chart and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2022.
                     Her second studio album, Happier Than Ever (2021), topped the charts in 25 countries.

                <p class="content"> Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles, California on December 18, 2001.[5]
                     She is the daughter of actress and teacher Maggie Baird[6][7] and actor Patrick O'Connell,[8]
                      both of whom are also musicians and work on Eilish's tours.[9][10][11] Eilish is of Irish and Scottish descent.[12]
                       She was conceived via in vitro fertilization.[13] Her middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name,
                        while Pirate was to be her middle name.[14] She was raised in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.[15][16]
                    Eilish and her brother Finneas were homeschooled by Baird, a decision their parents made to spend time with them and give them the freedom to pursue their interests.[8][11] Baird taught Eilish and Finneas the basics of songwriting.[17] Eilish said her brother and mother inspired her to get into music.[18] Their parents encouraged the siblings to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art, dancing, and acting.[9][17] Eilish also performed at talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight.[19][17] At age six, she started playing the ukulele.[20] She wrote her first "real" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series The Walking Dead from which she took script lines and episode titles for the song.[21][18] Eilish had gone on some acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Ramona and Beezus, and the X-Men series.[17] Eilish also took dance classes until 2016, 
                    when a growth plate injury put an end to her dancing career and she turned her focus toward recording music.</p>

                <h3>Musical style, songwriting, and music videos</h3>
                <p class="content2">ilish possesses a soprano vocal range. Avery Stone of Noisey described her vocals as "ethereal",
                     and Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone characterized them as "whispery". Doreen St. Félix of The New Yorker 
                    opined that she has a "husky, slurring voice that she can thin out to reedy". Music critic Robert Christgau wrote 
                    that while Eilish is musically and commercially pop, her brand also "reminds us how amorphous [pop] has become", 
                    describing her soprano as "too diminutive for vocal calisthenics", adding that her "playful version of teen-goth angst" 
                    and "electro-saturated debut album" captivated a diverse audience.Her music incorporates pop, dark pop,
                     electropop,[170] emo pop,[171] experimental pop, goth-pop, indie pop,teen pop,and alt-pop.
                     .Eilish and her brother, Finneas, collaborate on songwriting.[178][179] Finneas writes for Eilish's albums, 
                     produces her music, and also performs in live shows. Eilish and Finneas "like to completely make up things and become characters" and "have songs that are really fictional".[179] Eilish said a number of the songs also derive from her and Finneas' experiences.[179] They try to write "really interesting and conversational" lyrics: "We try to say stuff that doesn't have to be that deep [...] but you say something way deeper in a certain way that makes sense, but you haven't really thought about."[179] Finneas has stated that when he writes for his sister, he aims to "write [songs] that I think she'll relate to and enjoy singing and empathise with the lyrics and make her own".[181] When he writes with Eilish, he tries "to help her tell whatever story she's trying to tell, bounce ideas off of her, listen to her ideas", and use a language that fits her voice telling the story.[181]
                    
                    Eilish had wanted to direct her own music videos since age 14 but was initially not given the opportunity due to lack of 
                    experience. In 2019, she made her directorial debut with the video for her song "Xanny".
